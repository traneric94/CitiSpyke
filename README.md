### Technologies

Predyct is my attempt to get more familiar with javascript in the form of a full stack project. 

I used Node.js/mySQL backend, and D3.js incorporated with the Mapbox API to render the frontend.

Data provided by FordGoBike and Mapbox API.

This project was implemented over the course of 5 days and WILL be iteratively developed.


## Future Features

+ Applied Regression Analysis or Neural Net to predict bike availability at a future time.
+ Additional UI functionality to adjust departure time and location.
+ Incorporation of more APIs for more exhaustive bike data and possible Uber/Lyft rideshare data.
